# blender2unity-plugin
A small easy to use plugin to export fbx files directly from Blender to use in Unity.

After installing this plugin in Blender. A new tab appears in the tool menu called "easyExport". You can set a path where to output the fbx files. It exports the selected object and uses the objects name as file name.

# Known Issues
* Selecting multiple objects doesn't split them correctly.
* A relative path doesn't work in an expected way.
